# [Project 1: Cab Industry - Case Study](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/G2M-Case-study)
A private equity firm in the US wants to choose a can company to invest in. Due to remarkable growth in the cab industry in the last few years and multiple key players in the market, it is planning for an investment in the cab industry. The project's objective is to provide actionable insights to help the firm in identifying the right company for investing.

# [Project 2: Retail Price Optimization](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Retail-Price-Optimization)
This project forecasts weekly demand for products & recommends corresponding optimal prices for a retail chain using Machine Learning (random forest algorithm). The code is developed using python libraries like sklearn, MIP optimization in Gurobi.

# [Project 3: Data Glacier - Bank Marketing](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Bank_Week_7-)
A bank wants to sell its term deposit product to customers and before launching the product they want to develop a model which will help them in understanding whether a particular customer will buy their product or not (based on customerâ€™s past interaction with the bank and other financial institutions).

# [Project 4: Data Glacier - BMI Calculator](https://github.com/karanamsuryachandra/BMI-Calculator)
Body Mass Index (BMI) is predicted using a dataset in Kaggle. A predefined dataset of 500 people is used for training the ML model and BMI is predicted using Logistic Regression. 

# [Project 5: Machine Learning](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Machine-Learning)
# [1. Linear Regression](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)
Linear regression builds a relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. Equation y = mx+c is used in linear regression and perfect fit is chosen.  

# [2. Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Logistic%20Regression)
Logistic regression is appropriate when the dependent variable is binary.  Like all regression analyses, logistic regression is a predictive analysis. Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables. The output must be discrete in values or strings. 


# [Project 6: Deployment of ML Model using Heroku](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Heroku-Demo)
ML models are deployed in an open cloud source and can be accessed from anywhere.
