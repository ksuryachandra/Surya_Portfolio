# Surya Chandra - Portfolio

## Welcome to my Portfolio!

Here is a showcase of some of my exciting projects that demonstrate my expertise in data science and machine learning. Each project is accompanied by a brief description, providing insight into its objectives and accomplishments.

### [1. Power forecasting with machine leanirng and deep learning](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Hybrid-System-Power-Forecast) 

In this project, I utilized AI to forecast power generated by a hybrid solar and wind energy system. By exploring various algorithms, I identified the best performing model that forecasts environmental parameters like temperature, irradiance, wind speed, air density, etc., and predicts the consequent power generation. This universal model can be applied to any hybrid system worldwide.

### [2. Cab Industry - Case Study](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/G2M-Case-study)

As part of a private equity firm's investment decision-making process, I conducted a case study to analyze the cab industry in the US. By providing actionable insights, I assisted the firm in selecting the most suitable cab company for investment amidst the remarkable growth and competition in the market.

### [3. Bank Marketing - Data Glacier](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Bank_Week_7-)

For a bank looking to sell its term deposit product to customers, I developed a predictive model based on past interactions with the bank and other financial institutions. The model assists the bank in identifying potential customers likely to purchase the product.

### [4. BMI Calculator - Data Glacier](https://github.com/karanamsuryachandra/BMI-Calculator)

Using logistic regression and a Kaggle dataset of 500 individuals, I predicted Body Mass Index (BMI). This model provides a useful tool for estimating BMI based on specific parameters.

### [5. Machine Learning](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Machine-Learning)

#### [1. Linear Regression](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Linear%20Regression)

Linear regression involves fitting a linear equation to observed data, establishing a relationship between two variables - one explanatory and one dependent. I have employed the equation y = mx + c for linear regression, ensuring a perfect fit for the data.

#### [2. Logistic Regression](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Machine-Learning/tree/main/Logistic%20Regression)

Logistic regression is employed when the dependent variable is binary. It helps to explain the relationship between a binary dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The output is discrete, making it ideal for classification tasks.

### [6. Deployment of ML Model using Heroku](https://github.com/ksuryachandra/Heroku-Demo)

I have demonstrated my proficiency in deploying machine learning models using Heroku, an open cloud platform. This enables easy access to my ML models from any location.

Feel free to explore the individual project repositories for detailed insights and code implementation. I am passionate about data science and excited to contribute my skills to innovative projects. If you find my portfolio intriguing, I would be delighted to discuss potential opportunities with you.
